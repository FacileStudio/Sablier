// Package oidcavatar reads the profile claims Authentik returns at login.
//
// It used to download the picture and keep a copy on disk. It no longer does: the URL
// Authentik hands over is public, cacheable and served by Porte, so a local copy was a
// cache of something we are not the source of — one that a container rebuild silently
// emptied while the database went on pointing at it. Storing the URL removes the copy,
// the volume it needed, and the SSRF surface that fetching an attacker-influenced URL
// from inside our own network opened.

// PhotoURL returns the picture claim when it is a photo somebody actually chose, and ""
// when it is not.
//
// The distinction is the whole reason this function exists. Authentik never omits the
// claim: a user with no photo gets `data:image/svg+xml;base64,…`, its own rendering of
// their initials. Testing `picture != ""` — which every app in the suite did — therefore
// reads "has an avatar" as always true, which is why an upload could never be offered as
// the fallback and why the old fetch logged a failed HTTPS check every five minutes.
//
// An https URL is a file in Porte's media store. Anything else is a placeholder we can
// draw better ourselves, so it is reported as no photo at all.
